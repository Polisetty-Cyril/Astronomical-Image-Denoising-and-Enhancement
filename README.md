# Astronomical Image Denoising and Enhancement 🌌

This project focuses on denoising and enhancing astronomical images — specifically from the Hubble Space Telescope — using classical and deep learning techniques. The goal is to recover faint structures (e.g., stars, galaxies, dust lanes) hidden beneath instrumental and observational noise.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Remove additive noise from FITS images of galaxies (e.g., M51)
- Enhance faint astronomical signals while preserving structure
- Compare classical filters vs. deep learning methods (U-Net, autoencoders)

## 🧪 Data Source
Images are obtained from the [Hubble Legacy Archive](https://hla.stsci.edu/), especially in filters like F555W (green light).

## 📦 Tools and Libraries
- Python, Google Colab
- `astropy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
- (Planned) `tensorflow`, `pytorch` for deep learning

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/` — Main Colab notebooks
- `data/` — Sample FITS images
- `models/` — Saved denoising models (optional)

## ✍️ Author
